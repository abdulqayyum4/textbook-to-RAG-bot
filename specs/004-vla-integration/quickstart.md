# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides a high-level introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for beginner-intermediate robotics/AI learners. VLA systems integrate vision, language, and action to enable robots to understand and respond to human commands.

## Key Concepts

### 1. LLM-Robot Convergence
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with robotic systems
- Voice commands are processed using OpenAI Whisper
- Natural language is converted to actionable robot commands

### 2. Cognitive Planning
- High-level natural language commands are broken down into executable steps
- Planning algorithms determine the sequence of robot actions
- ROS 2 action sequences are generated for reliable execution

### 3. VLA Integration
- Vision, language, and action systems work together
- Autonomous humanoid robots execute complex tasks
- Voice commands coordinate navigation, vision, and manipulation
