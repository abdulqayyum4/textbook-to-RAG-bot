# Create Vision-Language-Action Tasks

## Summary
Created comprehensive, testable tasks for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) educational content module targeting beginner-intermediate robotics/AI learners.

## Task Breakdown
- **Total Tasks**: 50 tasks across 6 phases
- **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks for project initialization
- **Foundational Phase**: 4 tasks for blocking prerequisites
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 9 tasks for LLM-Robot Convergence
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 11 tasks for Cognitive Planning
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: 11 tasks for VLA Capstone Integration
- **Polish Phase**: 9 tasks for cross-cutting concerns

## Key Features
- All tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs and story labels
- Dependencies clearly defined (P1竊単2竊単3)
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- MVP scope defined (complete User Story 1)
- Independent test criteria for each user story
- RAG indexing and Docusaurus integration considerations

## Validation
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
- All tasks include specific file paths and clear descriptions
- Dependencies properly mapped between user stories
- Parallel execution opportunities identified for efficient development
- Quality assurance tasks included in final phase
